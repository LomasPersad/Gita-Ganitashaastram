,Translation
chpt1V1,"Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?"
chpt1V2,"Sanjay said: On observing the Pandava army standing in military formation, King Duryodhan approached his teacher Dronacharya, and said the following words."
chpt1V3,"Duryodhan said: Respected teacher!  Behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed for battle by your own gifted disciple, the son of Drupad."
chpt1V4,"Behold in their ranks are many powerful warriors, like Yuyudhan, Virat, and Drupad, wielding mighty bows and equal in military prowess to Bheem and Arjun.  There are also accomplished heroes like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the gallant King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Shaibya—all the best of men.  In their ranks, they also have the courageous Yudhamanyu, the gallant Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, who are all great warrior chiefs."
chpt1V7,"O best of Brahmins, hear too about the principal generals on our side, who are especially qualified to lead. These I now recount unto you."
chpt1V8,"There are personalities like yourself, Bheeshma, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Vikarn, and Bhurishrava, who are ever victorious in battle."
chpt1V9,"Also, there are many other heroic warriors, who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. They are all skilled in the art of warfare, and equipped with various kinds of weapons."
chpt1V10,"The strength of our army is unlimited and we are safely marshalled by Grandsire Bheeshma, while the strength of the Pandava army, carefully marshalled by Bheem, is limited."
chpt1V11,"Therefore, I call upon all the generals of the Kaurava army now to give full support to Grandsire Bheeshma, even as you defend your respective strategic points."
chpt1V12,"Then, the grand old man of the Kuru dynasty, the glorious patriarch Bheeshma, roared like a lion, and blew his conch shell very loudly, giving joy to Duryodhan."
chpt1V13,"Thereafter, conches, kettledrums, bugles, trumpets, and horns suddenly blared forth, and their combined sound was overwhelming."
chpt1V14,"Then, from amidst the Pandava army, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Madhav and Arjun blew their Divine conch shells."
chpt1V15,"Hrishikesh blew his conch shell, called Panchajanya, and Arjun blew the Devadutta. Bheem, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his mighty conch, called Paundra."
chpt1V16,"King Yudhishthir, blew the Anantavijay, while Nakul and Sahadev blew the Sughosh and Manipushpak. The excellent archer and king of Kashi, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virat, and the invincible Satyaki, Drupad, the five sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conch shells, O Ruler of the earth."
chpt1V19,"The terrific sound thundered across the sky and the earth, and shattered the hearts of your sons, O Dhritarasthra."
chpt1V20,"At that time, the son of Pandu, Arjun, who had the insignia of Hanuman on the flag of his chariot, took up his bow. Seeing your sons arrayed against him, O King, Arjun then spoke the following words to Shree Krishna."
chpt1V21,"Arjun said: O Infallible One, please take my chariot to the middle of both armies, so that I may look at the warriors arrayed for battle, whom I must fight in this great combat."
chpt1V23,"I desire to see those who have come here to fight on the side of the evil-minded son of Dhritarasthra, wishing to please him."
chpt1V24,"Sanjay said: O Dhritarasthra, having thus been addressed by Arjun, the conqueror of sleep, Shree Krishna then drew the magnificent chariot between the two armies."
chpt1V25,"In the presence of Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and all the other kings, Shree Krishna said: O Parth, behold these Kurus gathered here."
chpt1V26,"There, Arjun could see stationed in both armies, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, cousins, sons, nephews, grand-nephews, friends, fathers-in-law, and well-wishers."
chpt1V27,"Seeing all his relatives present there, Arjun, the son of Kunti, was overwhelmed with compassion, and with deep sorrow, spoke the following words."
chpt1V28,"Arjun said: O Krishna, seeing my own kinsmen arrayed for battle here and intent on killing each other, my limbs are giving way and my mouth is drying up."
chpt1V29,"My whole body shudders; my hair is standing on end. My bow, the Gāṇḍīv, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle."
chpt1V32,"O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it. Of what avail will be a kingdom, pleasures, or even life itself, when the very persons for whom we covet them, are standing before us for battle?"
chpt1V34,"Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, grandsons, fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen are present here, staking their lives and riches. O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?"
chpt1V36,"O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them. Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?"
chpt1V38,"Their thoughts are overpowered by greed and they see no wrong in annihilating their relatives or wreaking treachery upon friends. Yet, O Janardan (Krishna), why should we, who can clearly see the crime in killing our kindred, not turn away from this sin?"
chpt1V40,"When a dynasty is destroyed, its traditions get vanquished, and the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion."
chpt1V41,"With the preponderance of vice, O Krishna, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, O descendent of Vrishni, unwanted progeny are born."
chpt1V42,"An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall."
chpt1V43,"Through the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted progeny, a variety of social and family welfare activities are ruined."
chpt1V44,"O Janardan (Krishna), I have heard from the learned that those who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time."
chpt1V45,"Alas! How strange it is that we have set our mind to perform this great sin with horrifying consequences. Driven by the desire for kingly pleasures, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. It would be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield."
chpt1V47,"Sanjay said: Speaking thus, Arjun cast aside his bow and arrows, and sank into the seat of his chariot, his mind in distress and overwhelmed with grief."
chpt2V1,"Sanjay said: Seeing Arjun overwhelmed with pity, his mind grief-stricken, and his eyes full of tears, Shree Krishna spoke the following words."
chpt2V2,"The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjun, how has this delusion overcome you in this hour of peril?  It is not befitting an honorable person.  It leads not to the higher abodes, but to disgrace."
chpt2V3,"O Parth, it does not befit you to yield to this unmanliness.  Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O vanquisher of enemies."
chpt2V4,"Arjun said: O Madhusudan, how can I shoot arrows in battle on men like Bheeshma and Dronacharya, who are worthy of my worship, O destroyer of enemies?"
chpt2V5,"It would be better to live in this world by begging, than to enjoy life by killing these noble elders, who are my teachers. If we kill them, the wealth and pleasures we enjoy will be tainted with blood."
chpt2V6,"We do not even know which result of this war is preferable for us—conquering them or being conquered by them. Even after killing them we will not desire to live. Yet they have taken the side of the sons of Dhritarasthra, and now stand before us on the battlefield."
chpt2V7,"I am confused about my duty, and am besieged with anxiety and faintheartedness. I am Your disciple, and am surrendered to You. Please instruct me for certain what is best for me."
chpt2V8,"I can find no means of driving away this anguish that is drying up my senses. Even if I win a prosperous and unrivalled kingdom on the earth, or gain sovereignty like the celestial gods, I will be unable to dispel this grief."
chpt2V9,"Sanjay said: Having thus spoken, Gudakesh, that chastiser of enemies, addressed Hrishikesh: “Govind, I shall not fight,” and became silent."
chpt2V10,"O Dhritarashtra, thereafter, in the midst of both the armies, Shree Krishna smilingly spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjun."
chpt2V11,"The Supreme Lord said: While you speak words of wisdom, you are mourning for that which is not worthy of grief. The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead."
chpt2V12,"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be."
chpt2V13,"Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by this."
chpt2V14,"O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed."
chpt2V15,"O Arjun, noblest amongst men, that person who is not affected by happiness and distress, and remains steady in both, becomes eligible for liberation."
chpt2V16,"Of the transient there is no endurance, and of the eternal there is no cessation. This has verily been observed and concluded by the seers of the Truth, after studying the nature of both."
chpt2V17,"That which pervades the entire body, know it to be indestructible. No one can cause the destruction of the imperishable soul."
chpt2V18,"Only the material body is perishable; the embodied soul within is indestructible, immeasurable, and eternal. Therefore, fight, O descendent of Bharat."
chpt2V19,"Neither of them is in knowledge—the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed."
chpt2V20,"The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed."
chpt2V21,"O Parth, how can one who knows the soul to be imperishable, eternal, unborn, and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?"
chpt2V22,"As a person sheds worn-out garments and wears new ones, likewise, at the time of death, the soul casts off its worn-out body and enters a new one."
chpt2V23,"Weapons cannot shred the soul, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it."
chpt2V24,"The soul is unbreakable and incombustible; it can neither be dampened nor dried. It is everlasting, in all places, unalterable, immutable, and primordial."
chpt2V25,"The soul is spoken of as invisible, inconceivable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body."
chpt2V26,"If, however, you think that the self is subject to constant birth and death, O mighty-armed Arjun, even then you should not grieve like this."
chpt2V27,"Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable."
chpt2V28,"O scion of Bharat, all created beings are unmanifest before birth, manifest in life, and again unmanifest on death. So why grieve?"
chpt2V29,"Some see the soul as amazing, some describe it as amazing, and some hear of the soul as amazing, while others, even on hearing, cannot understand it at all."
chpt2V30,"O Arjun, the soul that dwells within the body is immortal; therefore, you should not mourn for anyone."
chpt2V31,"Besides, considering your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. Indeed, for a warrior, there is no better engagement than fighting for upholding of righteousness."
chpt2V32,"O Parth, happy are the warriors to whom such opportunities to defend righteousness come unsought, opening for them the stairway to the celestial abodes."
chpt2V33,"If, however, you refuse to fight this righteous war, abandoning your social duty and reputation, you will certainly incur sin."
chpt2V34,"People will speak of you as a coward and a deserter. For a respectable person, infamy is worse than death."
chpt2V35,"The great generals who hold you in high esteem will think that you fled from the battlefield out of fear, and thus will lose their respect for you."
chpt2V36,"Your enemies will defame and humiliate you with unkind words, disparaging your might. Alas, what could be more painful than that?"
chpt2V37,"If you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and go to the celestial abodes, or you will gain victory and enjoy the kingdom on earth. Therefore arise with determination, O son of Kunti, and be prepared to fight."
chpt2V38,"Fight for the sake of duty, treating alike happiness and distress, loss and gain, victory and defeat. Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin."
chpt2V39,"Hitherto, I have explained to you Sānkhya Yog, or analytic knowledge regarding the nature of the soul. Now listen, O Parth, as I reveal Buddhi Yog, or the Yog of Intellect. When you work with such understanding, you will be freed from the bondage of karma."
chpt2V40,"Working in this state of consciousness, there is no loss or adverse result, and even a little effort saves one from great danger."
chpt2V41,"O descendent of the Kurus, the intellect of those who are on this path is resolute, and their aim is one-pointed. But the intellect of those who are irresolute is many-branched."
chpt2V42,"Those with limited understanding, get attracted to the flowery words of the Vedas, which advocate ostentatious rituals for elevation to the celestial abodes, and presume no higher principle is described in them. They glorify only those portions of the Vedas that please their senses, and perform pompous ritualistic ceremonies for attaining high birth, opulence, sensual enjoyment, and elevation to the heavenly planets."
chpt2V44,"With their minds deeply attached to worldly pleasures and their intellects bewildered by such things, they are unable to possess the resolute determination for success on the path to God."
chpt2V45,"The Vedas deal with the three modes of material nature, O Arjun. Rise above the three modes to a state of pure spiritual consciousness. Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in Truth, and without concern for material gain and safety, be situated in the self."
chpt2V46,"Whatever purpose is served by a small well of water is naturally served in all respects by a large lake. Similarly, one who realizes the Absolute Truth also fulfills the purpose of all the Vedas."
chpt2V47,"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction."
chpt2V48,"Be steadfast in the performance of your duty, O Arjun, abandoning attachment to success and failure. Such equanimity is called Yog."
chpt2V49,"Seek refuge in divine knowledge and insight, O Arjun, and discard reward-seeking actions that are certainly inferior to works performed with the intellect established in divine knowledge. Miserly are those who seek to enjoy the fruits of their works."
chpt2V50,"One who prudently practices the science of work without attachment can get rid of both good and bad reactions in this life itself. Therefore, strive for Yog, which is the art of working skillfully (in proper consciousness)."
chpt2V51,"The wise endowed with equanimity of intellect, abandon attachment to the fruits of actions, which bind one to the cycle of life and death. By working in such consciousness, they attain the state beyond all suffering."
chpt2V52,"When your intellect crosses the quagmire of delusion, you will then acquire indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard (about enjoyments in this world and the next)."
chpt2V53,"When your intellect ceases to be allured by the fruitive sections of the Vedas and remains steadfast in divine consciousness, you will then attain the state of perfect Yog."
chpt2V54,"Arjun said : O Keshav, what is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness? How does an enlightened person talk? How does he sit? How does he walk?"
chpt2V55,"The Supreme Lord said: O Parth, when one discards all selfish desires and cravings of the senses that torment the mind, and becomes satisfied in the realization of the self, such a person is said to be transcendentally situated."
chpt2V56,"One whose mind remains undisturbed amidst misery, who does not crave for pleasure, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom."
chpt2V57,"One who remains unattached under all conditions, and is neither delighted by good fortune nor dejected by tribulation, he is a sage with perfect knowledge."
chpt2V58,"One who is able to withdraw the senses from their objects, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell, is established in divine wisdom."
chpt2V59,"Aspirants may restrain the senses from their objects of enjoyment, but the taste for the sense objects remains. However, even this taste ceases for those who realizes the Supreme."
chpt2V60,"The senses are so strong and turbulent, O son of Kunti, that they can forcibly carry away the mind even of a person endowed with discrimination who practices self-control."
chpt2V61,"They are established in perfect knowledge, who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in Me."
chpt2V62,"While contemplating on the objects of the senses, one develops attachment to them. Attachment leads to desire, and from desire arises anger."
chpt2V63,"Anger leads to clouding of judgment, which results in bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, the intellect gets destroyed; and when the intellect is destroyed, one is ruined."
chpt2V64,"But one who controls the mind, and is free from attachment and aversion, even while using the objects of the senses, attains the Grace of God."
chpt2V65,"By divine grace comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind soon becomes firmly established in God."
chpt2V66,"But an undisciplined person, who has not controlled the mind and senses, can neither have a resolute intellect nor steady contemplation on God. For one who never unites the mind with God there is no peace; and how can one who lacks peace be happy?"
chpt2V67,"Just as a strong wind sweeps a boat off its chartered course on the water, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can lead the intellect astray."
chpt2V68,"Therefore, one who has restrained the senses from their objects, O mighty armed Arjun, is firmly established in transcendental knowledge."
chpt2V69,"What all beings consider as day is the night of ignorance for the wise, and what all creatures see as night is the day for the introspective sage."
chpt2V70,"Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by the incessant flow of waters from rivers merging into it, likewise the sage who is unmoved despite the flow of desirable objects all around him attains peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy desires."
chpt2V71,"That person, who gives up all material desires and lives free from a sense of greed, proprietorship, and egoism, attains perfect peace."
chpt2V72,"O Parth, such is the state of an enlightened soul that having attained it, one is never again deluded. Being established in this consciousness even at the hour of death, one is liberated from the cycle of life and death and reaches the Supreme Abode of God."
chpt3V1,"Arjun said: O Janardan, if You consider knowledge superior to action, then why do You ask me to wage this terrible war? My intellect is bewildered by Your ambiguous advice. Please tell me decisively the one path by which I may attain the highest good."
chpt3V3,"The Lord said: O sinless one, the two paths leading to enlightenment were previously explained by Me: the path of knowledge, for those inclined toward contemplation, and the path of work for those inclined toward action."
chpt3V4,"One cannot achieve freedom from karmic reactions by merely abstaining from work, nor can one attain perfection of knowledge by mere physical renunciation."
chpt3V5,"There is no one who can remain without action even for a moment. Indeed, all beings are compelled to act by their qualities born of material nature (the three"
chpt3V6,"Those who restrain the external organs of action, while continuing to dwell on sense objects in the mind, certainly delude themselves and are to be called hypocrites."
chpt3V7,"But those karm yogis who control their knowledge senses with the mind, O Arjun, and engage the working senses in working without attachment, are certainly superior."
chpt3V8,"You should thus perform your prescribed Vedic duties, since action is superior to inaction. By ceasing activity, even your bodily maintenance will not be possible."
chpt3V9,"Work must be done as a yajna to the Supreme Lord; otherwise, work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, for the satisfaction of God, perform your prescribed duties, without being attached to the results."
chpt3V10,"In the beginning of creation, Brahma created humankind along with duties, and said, “Prosper in the performance of these"
chpt3V11,"By your sacrifices, the celestial gods will be pleased, and by cooperation between humans and the celestial gods, great prosperity will reign for all."
chpt3V12,"The celestial gods, being satisfied by the performance of sacrifice, will grant you all the desired necessities of life. But those who enjoy what is given to them, without making offerings in return, are verily thieves."
chpt3V13,"The spiritually-minded, who eat food that is first offered in sacrifice, are released from all kinds of sin. Others, who cook food for their own enjoyment, verily eat only sin."
chpt3V14,"All living beings subsist on food, and food is produced by rains. Rains come from the performance of sacrifice, and sacrifice is produced by the performance of prescribed duties."
chpt3V15,"The duties for human beings are described in the Vedas, and the Vedas are manifested by God Himself. Therefore, the all-pervading Lord is eternally present in acts of sacrifice."
chpt3V16,"O Parth, those who do not accept their responsibility in the cycle of sacrifice established by the Vedas are sinful. They live only for the delight of their senses; indeed their lives are in vain."
chpt3V17,"But those who rejoice in the self, who are illumined and fully satisfied in the self, for them, there is no duty."
chpt3V18,Such self-realized souls have nothing to gain or lose either in discharging or renouncing their duties. Nor do they need to depend on other living beings to fulfill their self-interest.
chpt3V19,"Therefore, giving up attachment, perform actions as a matter of duty because by working without being attached to the fruits, one attains the Supreme."
chpt3V20,"By performing their prescribed duties, King Janak and others attained perfection. You should also perform your duties to set an example for the good of the world. Whatever actions great persons perform, common people follow. Whatever standards they set, all the world pursues."
chpt3V22,"There is no duty for Me to do in all the three worlds, O Parth, nor do I have anything to gain or attain. Yet, I am engaged in prescribed duties."
chpt3V23,"For if I did not carefully perform the prescribed duties, O Parth, all men would follow My path in all respects."
chpt3V24,"If I ceased to perform prescribed actions, all these worlds would perish. I would be responsible for the pandemonium that would prevail, and would thereby destroy the peace of the human race."
chpt3V25,"As ignorant people perform their duties with attachment to the results, O scion of Bharat, so should the wise act without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path."
chpt3V26,"The wise should not create discord in the intellects of ignorant people, who are attached to fruitive actions, by inducing them to stop work. Rather, by performing their duties in an enlightened manner, they should inspire the ignorant also to do their prescribed duties."
chpt3V27,"All activities are carried out by the three modes of material nature. But in ignorance, the soul, deluded by false identification with the body, thinks of itself as the doer."
chpt3V28,"O mighty-armed Arjun, illumined persons distinguish the soul as distinct from"
chpt3V29,Those who are deluded by the operation of the
chpt3V30,"Performing all works as an offering unto Me, constantly meditate on Me as the Supreme. Become free from desire and selfishness, and with your mental grief departed, fight!"
chpt3V31,"Those who abide by these teachings of Mine, with profound faith and free from envy, are released from the bondage of karma."
chpt3V32,"But those who find faults with My teachings, being bereft of knowledge and devoid of discrimination, they disregard these principles and bring about their own ruin."
chpt3V33,"Even wise people act according to their natures, for all living beings are propelled by their natural tendencies. What will one gain by repression?"
chpt3V34,"The senses naturally experience attachment and aversion to the sense objects, but do not be controlled by them, for they are way-layers and foes."
chpt3V35,"It is far better to perform one’s natural prescribed duty, though tinged with faults, than to perform another’s prescribed duty, though perfectly. In fact, it is preferable to die in the discharge of one’s duty, than to follow the path of another, which is fraught with danger."
chpt3V36,"Arjun asked: Why is a person impelled to commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force, O descendent of Vrishni (Krishna)?"
chpt3V37,"The Supreme Lord said: It is lust alone, which is born of contact with the mode of passion, and later transformed into anger. Know this as the sinful, all-devouring enemy in the world."
chpt3V38,"Just as a fire is covered by smoke, a mirror is masked by dust, and an embryo is concealed by the womb, similarly one’s knowledge gets shrouded by desire."
chpt3V39,"The knowledge of even the most discerning gets covered by this perpetual enemy in the form of insatiable desire, which is never satisfied and burns like fire, O son of Kunti."
chpt3V40,"The senses, mind, and intellect are said to be breeding grounds of desire. Through them, it clouds one’s knowledge and deludes the embodied soul."
chpt3V41,"Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning bring the senses under control and slay this enemy called desire, which is the embodiment of sin and destroys knowledge and realization."
chpt3V42,"The senses are superior to the gross body, and superior to the senses is the mind. Beyond the mind is the intellect, and even beyond the intellect is the soul."
chpt3V43,"Thus knowing the soul to be superior to the material intellect, O mighty armed Arjun, subdue the lower self (senses, mind, and intellect) by the higher self (strength of the soul), and kill this formidable enemy called lust."
chpt4V1,"The Supreme Lord Shree Krishna said: I taught this eternal science of Yog to the Sun God, Vivasvan, who passed it on to Manu; and Manu, in turn, instructed it to Ikshvaku."
chpt4V2,"O subduer of enemies, the saintly kings thus received this science of Yog in a continuous tradition. But with the long passage of time, it was lost to the world."
chpt4V3,"The same ancient knowledge of Yog, which is the supreme secret, I am today revealing unto you, because you are My friend as well as My devotee, who can understand this transcendental wisdom."
chpt4V4,Arjun said: You were born much after Vivasvan. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?
chpt4V5,"The Supreme Lord said: Both you and I have had many births, O Arjun. You have forgotten them, while I remember them all, O Parantapa."
chpt4V6,"Although I am unborn, the Lord of all living entities, and have an imperishable nature, yet I appear in this world by virtue of"
chpt4V7,"Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, O Arjun, at that time I manifest Myself on earth."
chpt4V8,"To protect the righteous, to annihilate the wicked, and to reestablish the principles of dharma I appear on this earth, age after age."
chpt4V9,"Those who understand the divine nature of My birth and activities, O Arjun, upon leaving the body, do not have to take birth again, but come to My eternal abode."
chpt4V10,"Being free from attachment, fear, and anger, becoming fully absorbed in Me, and taking refuge in Me, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me, and thus attained My divine love."
chpt4V11,"In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows My path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha."
chpt4V12,"In this world, those desiring success in material activities worship the celestial gods, since material rewards manifest quickly."
chpt4V13,"The four categories of occupations were created by Me according to people’s qualities and activities. Although I am the Creator of this system, know Me to be the Non-doer and Eternal."
chpt4V14,"Activities do not taint Me, nor do I desire the fruits of action. One who knows Me in this way is never bound by the karmic reactions of work."
chpt4V15,"Knowing this truth, even seekers of liberation in ancient times performed actions. Therefore, following the footsteps of those ancient sages, you too should perform your duty."
chpt4V16,"What is action and what is inaction? Even the wise are confused in determining this. Now I shall explain to you the secret of action, by knowing which, you may free yourself from material bondage."
chpt4V17,"You must understand the nature of all three—recommended action, wrong action, and inaction. The truth about these is profound and difficult to understand."
chpt4V18,"Those who see action in inaction and inaction in action are truly wise amongst humans. Although performing all kinds of actions, they are yogis and masters of all their actions."
chpt4V19,"The enlightened sages call those persons wise, whose every action is free from the desire for material pleasures and who have burnt the reactions of work in the fire of divine knowledge."
chpt4V20,"Such people, having given up attachment to the fruits of their actions, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all."
chpt4V21,"Free from expectations and the sense of ownership, with the mind and intellect fully controlled, they incur no sin even though performing actions by their body."
chpt4V22,"Content with whatever gain comes of its own accord, and free from envy, they are beyond the dualities of life. Being equipoised in success and failure, they are not bound by their actions, even while performing all kinds of activities."
chpt4V23,"They are released from the bondage of material attachments and their intellect is established in divine knowledge. Since they perform all actions as a sacrifice (to God), they are freed from all karmic reactions."
chpt4V24,"For those who are completely absorbed in God-consciousness, the oblation is Brahman, the ladle with which it is offered is Brahman, the act of offering is Brahman, and the sacrificial fire is also Brahman. Such persons, who view everything as God, easily attain Him."
chpt4V25,Some yogis worship the celestial gods with material offerings unto them. Others worship perfectly who offer the self as sacrifice in the fire of the Supreme Truth.
chpt4V26,Others offer hearing and other senses in the sacrificial fire of restraint. Still others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.
chpt4V27,"Some, inspired by knowledge, offer the functions of all their senses and their life energy in the fire of the controlled mind."
chpt4V28,"Some offer their wealth as sacrifice, while others offer severe austerities as sacrifice. Some practice the eight-fold path of yogic practices, and yet others study the scriptures and cultivate knowledge as sacrifice, while observing strict vows."
chpt4V29,"Still others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming breath, while some offer the incoming breath into the outgoing breath. Some arduously practice"
chpt4V31,"Those who know the secret of sacrifice, and engaging in it, partake of its remnants that are like nectar, advance toward the Absolute Truth. O best of the Kurus, those who perform no sacrifice find no happiness either in this world or the next."
chpt4V32,All these different kinds of sacrifice have been described in the Vedas. Know them as originating from different types of work; this understanding cuts the knots of material bondage.
chpt4V33,"O subduer of enemies, sacrifice performed in knowledge is superior to any mechanical material sacrifice. After all, O Parth, all sacrifices of work culminate in knowledge."
chpt4V34,Learn the Truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the Truth.
chpt4V35,"Following this path and having achieved enlightenment from a Guru, O Arjun, you will no longer fall into delusion. In the light of that knowledge, you will see that all living beings are but parts of the Supreme, and are within Me."
chpt4V36,Even those who are considered the most immoral of all sinners can cross over this ocean of material existence by seating themselves in the boat of divine knowledge.
chpt4V37,"As a kindled fire reduces wood to ashes, O Arjun, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions from material activities."
chpt4V38,"In this world, there is nothing as purifying as divine knowledge. One who has attained purity of mind through prolonged practice of Yog, receives such knowledge within the heart, in due course of time."
chpt4V39,"Those whose faith is deep and who have practiced controlling their mind and senses attain divine knowledge. Through such transcendental knowledge, they quickly attain everlasting supreme peace."
chpt4V40,"But persons who possess neither faith nor knowledge, and who are of a doubting nature, suffer a downfall. For the skeptical souls, there is no happiness either in this world or the next."

With the light of divine knowledge, they see that it is only the material senses that are moving amongst their objects."
chpt5V10,"Those who dedicate their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin, just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water."

chpt5V15,The omnipresent God does not involve Himself in the sinful or virtuous deeds of anyone.  The living entities are deluded because their inner knowledge is covered by ignorance.

chpt5V17,"Those whose intellect is fixed in God, who are completely absorbed in God, with firm faith in Him as the supreme goal, such persons quickly reach the state from which there is no return, their sins having been dispelled by the light of knowledge."
chpt5V18,"The truly learned, with the eyes of divine knowledge, see with equal vision a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater."
chpt5V19,"Those whose minds are established in equality of vision conquer the cycle of birth and death in this very life.  They possess the flawless qualities of God, and are therefore seated in the Absolute Truth."
chpt5V20,"Established in God, having a firm understanding of divine knowledge and not hampered by delusion, they neither rejoice in getting something pleasant nor grieve on experiencing the unpleasant."
chpt5V21,"Those who are not attached to external sense pleasures realize divine bliss in the self.  Being united with God through Yog, they experience unending happiness."
chpt5V22,"The pleasures that arise from contact with the sense objects, though appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people, are verily a source of misery.  O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, so the wise do not delight in them."
chpt5V23,"Those persons are yogis, who before giving up the body are able to check the forces of desire and anger; and they alone are happy."
chpt5V24,"Those who are happy within themselves, enjoying the delight of God within, and are illumined by the inner light, such yogis are united with the Lord and are liberated from material existence."

chpt6V5,"Elevate yourself through the power of your mind, and not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self."
chpt6V6,"For those who have conquered the mind, it is their friend. For those who have failed to do so, the mind works like an enemy."
chpt6V7,"The yogis who have conquered the mind rise above the dualities of cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and honor and dishonor. Such yogis remain peaceful and steadfast in their devotion to God."
chpt6V8,"The yogi who are satisfied by knowledge and discrimination, and have conquered their senses, remain undisturbed in all circumstances. They see everything—dirt, stones, and gold—as the same."
chpt6V9,"The yogis look upon all—well-wishers, friends, foes, the pious, and the sinners—with an impartial intellect. The yogi who is of equal intellect toward friend, companion, and foe, neutral among enemies and relatives, and unbiased between the righteous and sinful, is considered to be distinguished among humans."

chpt6V17,"But those who are temperate in eating and recreation, balanced in work, and regulated in sleep, can mitigate all sorrows by practicing Yog."
chpt6V18,"With thorough discipline, they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and rivet it on the unsurpassable good of the self. Such persons are said to be in Yog, and are free from all yearning of the senses."
chpt6V19,"Just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker, so the disciplined mind of a yogi"
chpt6V20,"When the mind, restrained from material activities, becomes still by the practice of Yog, then the yogi is able to behold the soul through the purified mind, and he rejoices in the inner joy."
chpt6V21,"In that joyous state of Yog, called"
chpt6V22,"Having gained that state, one does not consider any attainment to be greater. Being thus established, one is not shaken even in the midst of the greatest calamity."
chpt6V23,That state of severance from union with misery is known as Yog. This Yog should be resolutely practiced with determination free from pessimism.
chpt6V24,"Completely renouncing all desires arising from thoughts of the world, one should restrain the senses from all sides with the mind. Slowly and steadily, with conviction in the intellect, the mind will become fixed in God alone, and will think of nothing else."
chpt6V26,"Whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it on God."
chpt6V27,"Great transcendental happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is calm, whose passions are subdued, who is without sin, and who sees everything in connection with God."
chpt6V28,"The self-controlled yogi, thus uniting the self with God, becomes free from material contamination, and being in constant touch with the Supreme, achieves the highest state of perfect happiness."

chpt6V32,I regard them to be perfect yogis who see the true equality of all living beings and respond to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were their own.
chpt6V33,"Arjun said: The system of Yog that you have described, O Madhusudan, appears impractical and unattainable to me, due to the restless mind."
chpt6V34,"The mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate, O Krishna. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind."
chpt6V35,"Lord Krishna said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, what you say is correct; the mind is indeed very difficult to restrain. But by practice and detachment, it can be controlled."
chpt6V36,"Yog is difficult to attain for one whose mind is unbridled. However, those who have learnt to control the mind, and who strive earnestly by proper means, can attain perfection in Yog. This is My opinion."
chpt6V37,"Arjun said: What is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but who does not endeavor sufficiently due to an unsteady mind and is unable to reach the goal of Yog in this life?"
chpt6V38,"Does not such a person who deviates from Yog get deprived of both material and spiritual success, O mighty-armed Krishna, and perish like a broken cloud with no position in either sphere?"
chpt6V39,"O Krishna, please dispel this doubt of mine completely, for who other than You can do so?"
chpt6V40,"The Supreme Lord said: O Parth, one who engages on the spiritual path does not meet with destruction either in this world or the world to come. My dear friend, one who strives for God-realization is never overcome by evil."
chpt6V41,"The unsuccessful yogis, upon death, go to the abodes of the virtuous. After dwelling there for many ages, they are again reborn in the earth plane, into a family of pious and prosperous people. Else, if they had developed dispassion due to long practice of Yog, they are born into a family endowed with divine wisdom. Such a birth is very difficult to attain in this world."
chpt6V43,"On taking such a birth, O descendant of Kurus, they reawaken the wisdom of their previous lives, and strive even harder toward perfection in Yog."
chpt6V44,"Indeed, they feel drawn toward God, even against their will, on the strength of their past discipline. Such seekers naturally rise above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures."
chpt6V45,"With the accumulated merits of many past births, when these yogis engage in sincere endeavors to make further progress, they become purified from material desires and attain perfection in this life itself."

chpt7V7,"There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjun. Everything rests in Me, as beads strung on a thread."
chpt7V8,"I am the taste in water, O son of Kunti, and the radiance of the sun and the moon. I am the sacred syllable Om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether, and the ability in humans."
chpt7V9,"I am the pure fragrance of the Earth, and the brilliance in fire. I am the life-force in all beings, and the penance of the ascetics."
chpt7V10,"O Arjun, know that I am the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent, and the splendor of the glorious."
chpt7V11,"O best of the Bharatas, in strong persons, I am their strength devoid of desire and passion. I am sexual activity not conflicting with virtue or scriptural injunctions."
chpt7V12,"The three states of material existence—goodness, passion, and ignorance—are manifested by My energy. They are in Me, but I am beyond them."
chpt7V13,"Deluded by the three modes of Maya, people in this world are unable to know Me, the imperishable and eternal."
chpt7V14,"My divine energy Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto Me cross over it easily."
chpt7V15,"Four kinds of people do not surrender unto Me—those ignorant of knowledge, those who lazily follow their lower nature though capable of knowing Me, those with deluded intellect, and those with a demoniac nature."
chpt7V16,"O best amongst the Bharatas, four kinds of pious people engage in My devotion—the distressed, the seekers of knowledge, the seekers of worldly possessions, and those who are situated in knowledge."
chpt7V17,"Amongst these, I consider them to be the highest, who worship Me with knowledge, and are steadfastly and exclusively devoted to Me. I am very dear to them and they are very dear to Me."
chpt7V18,"All those who are devoted to Me are indeed noble. But those in knowledge, who are of steadfast mind, whose intellect is merged in Me, and who have made Me alone as their supreme goal, I consider as My very self."
chpt7V19,"After many births of spiritual practice, one who is endowed with knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be all that is. Such a great soul is indeed very rare."
chpt7V20,"Those whose knowledge has been carried away by material desires surrender to the celestial gods. Following their own nature, they worship the"
chpt7V21,"Whatever celestial form a devotee seeks to worship with faith, I steady the faith of such a devotee in that form."
chpt7V22,"Endowed with faith, the devotee worships a particular celestial god and obtains the objects of desire. But in reality, I alone arrange these benefits."
chpt7V23,"But the fruit gained by these people of little understanding is perishable. Those who worship the celestial gods go to the celestial abodes, while My devotees come to Me."
chpt7V24,"The less intelligent think that I, the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, was formless earlier and have now assumed this personality. They do not understand the imperishable exalted nature of My personal form."
chpt7V25,"I am not manifest to everyone, being veiled by My divine"
chpt7V26,"O Arjun, I know of past, present, and future, and I also know all living beings; but Me no one knows."
chpt7V27,"O descendant of Bharat, the dualities of desire and aversion arise from illusion. O conqueror of enemies, all living beings in the material realm are deluded by these."
chpt7V28,"But persons, whose sins have been destroyed by engaging in pious activities, become free from the illusion of dualities. Such persons worship Me with determination."
chpt7V29,"Those who take shelter in Me, striving for liberation from old-age and death, come to know the Brahman, the individual self, and the entire field of karmic action."

chpt8V5,Those who relinquish the body while remembering Me at the moment of death will come to Me. There is certainly no doubt about this.
chpt8V6,"Whatever one remembers upon giving up the body at the time of death, O son of Kunti, one attains that state, being always absorbed in such contemplation."
chpt8V7,"Therefore, always remember Me and also do your duty of fighting the war.  With mind and intellect surrendered to Me, you will definitely attain Me; of this, there is no doubt."
chpt8V8,"With practice, O Parth, when you constantly engage the mind in remembering Me, the Supreme Divine Personality, without deviating, you will certainly attain Me."
chpt8V9,"God is Omniscient, the most ancient One, the Controller, subtler than the subtlest, the Support of all, and the possessor of an inconceivable divine form; He is brighter than the sun, and beyond all darkness of ignorance.  One who at the time of death, with unmoving mind attained by the practice of Yog, fixes the"
chpt8V11,Scholars of the Vedas describe Him as Imperishable; great ascetics practice the vow of celibacy and renounce worldly pleasures to enter into Him.  I shall now explain to you briefly the path to that goal.
chpt8V12,"Restraining all the gates of the body and fixing the mind in the heart region, and then drawing the life-breath to the head, one should get established in steadfast yogic concentration."
chpt8V13,"One who departs from the body while remembering Me, the Supreme Personality, and chanting the syllable Om, will attain the supreme goal."
chpt8V14,"O Parth, for those yogis who always think of Me with exclusive devotion, I am easily attainable because of their constant absorption in Me."
chpt8V15,"Having attained Me, the great souls are no more subject to rebirth in this world, which is transient and full of misery, because they have attained the highest perfection."
chpt8V16,"In all the worlds of this material creation, up to the highest abode of Brahma, you will be subject to rebirth, O Arjun.  But on attaining My Abode, O son of Kunti, there is no further rebirth."

chpt8V19,"Multitudes of beings repeatedly take birth with the advent of Brahma’s day, and are reabsorbed on the arrival of the cosmic night, to manifest again automatically on the advent of the next cosmic day."
chpt8V20,"Transcendental to this manifest and unmanifest creation, there is yet another unmanifest eternal dimension.  That realm does not cease even when all others do."
chpt8V21,"That unmanifest dimension is the supreme goal, and upon reaching it, one never returns to this mortal world.  That is My Supreme Abode."
chpt8V22,"The Supreme Divine Personality is greater than all that exists.  Although He is all-pervading and all living beings are situated in Him, yet He can be known only through devotion."
chpt8V23,"I shall now describe to you the different paths of passing away from this world, O best of the Bharatas, one of which leads to liberation and the other leads to rebirth.  Those who know the Supreme Brahman and who depart from this world, during the six months of the sun’s northern course, the bright fortnight of the moon, and the bright part of the day, attain the supreme destination.  The practitioners of Vedic rituals, who pass away during the six months of the sun’s southern course, the dark fortnight of the moon, the time of smoke, the night, attain the celestial abodes.  After enjoying celestial pleasures, they again return to the earth.  These two, bright and dark paths, always exist in this world.  The way of light leads to liberation and the way of darkness leads to rebirth."
chpt8V27,"Yogis who know the secret of these two paths, O Parth, are never bewildered.  Therefore, at all times be situated in Yog (union with God)."
chpt8V28,"The yogis, who know this secret, gain merit far beyond the fruits of Vedic rituals, the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities.  Such yogis reach the Supreme Abode."
chpt9V1,"The Supreme Lord said:  O Arjun, because you are not envious of Me, I shall now impart to you this very confidential knowledge and wisdom, upon knowing which you will be released from the miseries of material existence."

chpt9V11,"When I descend in My personal form deluded persons are unable to recognize Me.  They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings."
chpt9V12,"Bewildered by the material energy, such persons embrace demoniac and atheistic views.  In that deluded state, their hopes for welfare are in vain, their fruitive actions are wasted, and their culture of knowledge is baffled."
chpt9V13,"But the great souls, who take shelter of My divine energy, O Parth, know Me, Lord Krishna, as the origin of all creation.  They engage in My devotion with their minds fixed exclusively on Me."

chpt9V23,"O son of Kunti, even those devotees who faithfully worship other gods also worship Me.  But they do so by the wrong method."
chpt9V24,I am the enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices.  But those who fail to realize My divine nature must be reborn.
chpt9V25,"Worshippers of the celestial gods take birth amongst the celestial gods, worshippers of the ancestors go to the ancestors, worshippers of ghosts take birth amongst such beings, and My devotees come to Me alone."

chpt9V27,"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever you bestow as a gift, and whatever austerities you perform, O son of Kunti, do them as an offering to Me."
chpt9V28,"By dedicating all your works to Me, you will be freed from the bondage of good and bad results.  With your mind attached to Me through renunciation, you will be liberated and will reach Me."
chpt9V29,I am equally disposed to all living beings; I am neither inimical nor partial to anyone.  But the devotees who worship Me with love reside in Me and I reside in them.

chpt11V36,"Arjun said: O Master of the senses, it is but apt that the universe rejoices in giving You praise and is enamored by You. Demons flee fearfully from You in all directions and hosts of perfected saints bow to You."
chpt11V37,"O Great One, who are even greater than Brahma, the original creator, why should they not bow to you? O Limitless One, O Lord of the"
chpt11V38,"You are the primeval God and the original Divine Personality; You are the sole resting place of this universe. You are both the knower and the object of knowledge; You are the Supreme Abode. O possessor of infinite forms, You alone pervade the entire universe."
chpt11V39,You are
chpt11V40,"O Lord of infinite power, my salutations to You from the front and the rear, indeed from all sides! You possess infinite valor and might and pervade everything, and thus, You are everything."
chpt11V41,"Thinking of You as my friend, I presumptuously addressed You as, “O Krishna,” “O Yadav,” “O my dear Friend.” I was ignorant of Your majesty, showing negligence and undue affection. And if, jestfully, I treated You with disrespect, while playing, resting, sitting, eating, when alone, or before others—for all that I crave forgiveness."
chpt11V43,"You are the Father of the entire universe, of all moving and non-moving beings. You are the most deserving of worship and the Supreme Spiritual Master. When there is none equal to You in all the three worlds, then who can possibly be greater than You, O Possessor of incomparable power?"
chpt11V44,"Therefore, O adorable Lord, bowing deeply and prostrating before You, I implore You for Your grace. As a father tolerates his son, a friend forgives his friend, and a lover pardons the beloved, please forgive me for my offences."
chpt11V45,"Having seen Your universal form that I had never seen before, I feel great joy. And yet, my mind trembles with fear. Please have mercy on me and again show me Your pleasing form, O God of gods, O Abode of the universe."

chpt11V48,"Not by study of the Vedas, nor by the performance of sacrifice, rituals, or charity, nor even by practicing severe austerities, has any mortal ever seen what you have seen, O best of the Kuru warriors."
chpt11V49,"Be neither afraid nor bewildered on seeing this terrible form of Mine. Be free from fear and with a cheerful heart, behold Me once again in My personal form."
chpt11V50,"Sanjay said: Having spoken thus, the compassionate son of Vasudev displayed His personal (four-armed) form again. Then, He further consoled the frightened Arjun by assuming His gentle (two-armed) form."
chpt11V51,"Arjun said: O Shree Krishna, seeing Your gentle human form (two-armed), I have regained my composure and my mind is restored to normal."
chpt11V52,"The Supreme Lord said: This form of Mine that you are seeing is exceedingly difficult to behold. Even the celestial gods are eager to see it. Neither by the study of the Vedas, nor by penance, charity, or fire sacrifices, can I be seen as you have seen Me."
chpt11V54,"O Arjun, by unalloyed devotion alone can I be known as I am, standing before you. Thereby, on receiving My divine vision, O scorcher of foes, one can enter into union with Me."
chpt11V55,"Those who perform all their duties for My sake, who depend upon Me and are devoted to Me, who are free from attachment, and are without malice toward all beings, such devotees certainly come to Me."
chpt12V1,"Arjun inquired: Between those who are steadfastly devoted to Your personal form and those who worship the formless Brahman, whom do You consider to be more perfect in Yog?"
chpt12V2,"The Lord said: Those who fix their minds on Me and always engage in My devotion with steadfast faith, I consider them to be the best yogis."
chpt12V3,"But those who worship the formless aspect of the Absolute Truth—the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the all-pervading, the unthinkable, the unchanging, the eternal, and the immoveable—by restraining their senses and being even-minded everywhere, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all beings, also attain Me."
chpt12V5,"For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifest, the path of realization is full of tribulations.  Worship of the unmanifest is exceedingly difficult for embodied beings."
chpt12V6,"But those who dedicate all their actions to Me, regarding Me as the Supreme goal, worshiping Me and meditating on Me with exclusive devotion, O Parth, I swiftly deliver them from the ocean of birth and death, for their consciousness is united with Me."
chpt12V8,"Fix your mind on Me alone and surrender your intellect to Me.  There upon, you will always live in Me.  Of this, there is no doubt."
chpt12V9,"If you are unable to fix your mind steadily on Me, O Arjun, then practice remembering Me with devotion while constantly restraining the mind from worldly affairs."
chpt12V10,"If you cannot practice remembering Me with devotion, then just try to work for Me.  Thus performing devotional service to Me, you shall achieve the stage of perfection."
chpt12V11,"If you are unable to even work for Me in devotion, then try to renounce the fruits of your actions and be situated in the self."
chpt12V12,"Better than mechanical practice is knowledge; better than knowledge is meditation.  Better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of actions, for peace immediately follows such renunciation."
chpt12V13,"Those devotees are very dear to Me who are free from malice toward all living beings, who are friendly, and compassionate.  They are free from attachment to possessions and egotism, equipoised in happiness and distress, and ever-forgiving.   They are ever-content, steadily united with Me in devotion, self-controlled, of firm resolve, and dedicated to Me in mind and intellect."
chpt12V15,"Those who are not a source of annoyance to anyone and who in turn are not agitated by anyone, who are equal in pleasure and pain, and free from fear and anxiety, such devotees of Mine are very dear to Me."
chpt12V16,"Those who are indifferent to worldly gains, externally and internally pure, skillful, without cares, untroubled, and free from selfishness in all undertakings, such devotees of Mine are very dear to Me."
chpt12V17,"Those who neither rejoice in mundane pleasures nor despair in worldly sorrows, who neither lament for any loss nor hanker for any gain, who renounce both good and evil deeds, such persons who are full of devotion are very dear to Me."
chpt12V18,"Those, who are alike to friend and foe, equipoised in honor and dishonor, cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and are free from all unfavorable association; those who take praise and reproach alike, who are given to silent contemplation, content with what comes their way, without attachment to the place of residence, whose intellect is firmly fixed in Me, and who are full of devotion to Me, such persons are very dear to Me."
chpt12V20,"Those who honor this nectar of wisdom declared here, have faith in Me, and are devoted and intent on Me as the supreme goal, they are exceedingly dear to Me."

chpt13V2,"The Supreme Divine Lord said: O Arjun, this body is termed as"
chpt13V3,"O scion of Bharat, I am also the knower of all the individual fields of activity.  The understanding of the body as the field of activities, and the soul and God as the knowers of the field, this I hold to be true knowledge."
chpt13V4,"Listen and I will explain to you what that field is and what its nature is.  I will also explain how change takes place within it, from what it was created, who the knower of the field of activities is, and what his powers are."
chpt13V5,"Great sages have sung the truth about the field and the knower of the field in manifold ways.  It has been stated in various Vedic hymns, and especially revealed in the Brahma Sūtra, with sound logic and conclusive evidence."
chpt13V6,"The field of activities is composed of the five great elements, the ego, the intellect, the unmanifest primordial matter, the eleven senses (five knowledge senses, five working senses, and mind), and the five objects of the senses."
chpt13V7,"Desire and aversion, happiness and misery, the body, consciousness, and the will—all these comprise the field and its modifications."
chpt13V8,"Humbleness; freedom from hypocrisy; non-violence; forgiveness; simplicity; service of the Guru; cleanliness of body and mind; steadfastness; and self-control; dispassion toward the objects of the senses; absence of egotism; keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old age, and death; non-attachment; absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on; even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life; constant and exclusive devotion toward Me; an inclination for solitary places and an aversion for mundane society; constancy in spiritual knowledge; and philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth—all these I declare to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it, I call ignorance."
chpt13V13,"I shall now reveal to you that which ought to be known, and by knowing which, one attains immortality.  It is the beginningless Brahman, which lies beyond existence and non-existence."
chpt13V14,"Everywhere are His hands and feet, eyes, heads, and faces.  His ears too are in all places, for He pervades everything in the universe."
chpt13V15,"Though He perceives all sense-objects, yet He is devoid of the senses.  He is unattached to everything, and yet He is the sustainer of all.  Although He is without attributes, yet He is the enjoyer of the three modes of material nature."
chpt13V16,"He exists outside and inside all living beings, those that are moving and not moving.  He is subtle, and hence, He is incomprehensible.  He is very far, but He is also very near."
chpt13V17,"He is indivisible, yet He appears to be divided amongst living beings.  Know the Supreme Entity to be the Sustainer, Annihilator, and Creator of all beings."
chpt13V18,"He is the source of light in all luminaries, and is entirely beyond the darkness of ignorance.  He is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge.  He dwells within the hearts of all living beings."
chpt13V19,"I have thus revealed to you the nature of the field, the meaning of knowledge, and the object of knowledge.  Only My devotees can understand this in reality, and by doing so, they attain My divine nature."

chpt13V24,"Those who understand the truth about Supreme Soul, the individual soul, material nature, and the interaction of the three modes of nature will not take birth here again.  They will be liberated regardless of their present condition."
chpt13V25,"Some try to perceive the Supreme Soul within their hearts through meditation, and others try to do so through the cultivation of knowledge, while still others strive to attain that realization by the path of action."
chpt13V26,"There are still others who are unaware of these spiritual paths, but they hear from others and begin worshipping the Supreme Lord.  By such devotion to hearing from saints, they too can gradually cross over the ocean of birth and death."
chpt13V27,"O best of the Bharatas, whatever moving or unmoving being you see in existence, know it to be a combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field."
chpt13V28,"They alone truly see, who perceive the"
chpt13V29,"Those, who see God as the Supreme Soul equally present everywhere and in all living beings, do not degrade themselves by their mind.  Thereby, they reach the supreme destination."
chpt13V30,"They alone truly see who understand that all actions (of the body) are performed by material nature, while the embodied soul actually does nothing."
chpt13V31,"When they see the diverse variety of living beings situated in the same material nature, and understand all of them to be born from it, they attain the realization of the Brahman."
chpt13V32,"The Supreme Soul is imperishable, without beginning, and devoid of any material qualities, O son of Kunti.  Although situated within the body, It neither acts, nor is It tainted by material energy."
chpt13V33,"Space holds everything within it, but being subtle, does not get contaminated by what it holds.  Similarly, though its consciousness pervades the body, the soul is not affected by the attributes of the body."
chpt13V34,"Just as one sun illumines the entire solar system, so does the individual soul illumine the entire body (with consciousness)."
chpt13V35,"Those who perceive with the eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and the process of release from material nature, attain the supreme destination."
chpt14V1,"The Divine Lord said: I shall once again explain to you the supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge; by knowing which, all the great saints attained the highest perfection."
chpt14V2,Those who take refuge in this wisdom will be united with Me. They will not be reborn at the time of creation nor destroyed at the time of dissolution.

When the mode of passion predominates, O Arjun, the symptoms of greed, exertion for worldly gain, restlessness, and craving develop. O Arjun, nescience, inertia, negligence, and delusion—these are the dominant signs of the mode of ignorance."
chpt14V14,Those who die with predominance of

chpt14V18,Those situated in the mode of goodness rise upward; those in the mode of passion stay in the middle; and those in the mode of ignorance go downward.

chpt14V22,"The Supreme Divine Personality said: O Arjun, The persons who are transcendental to the three"
chpt14V24,"Those who are alike in happiness and distress; who are established in the self; who look upon a clod, a stone, and a piece of gold as of equal value; who remain the same amidst pleasant and unpleasant events; who are intelligent; who accept both blame and praise with equanimity; who remain the same in honor and dishonor; who treat both friend and foe alike; and who have abandoned all enterprises – they are said to have risen above the three"
chpt14V26,Those who serve Me with unalloyed devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and come to the level of the Brahman.
chpt14V27,"I am the basis of the formless Brahman, the immortal and imperishable, of eternal dharma, and of unending divine bliss."

chpt15V3,"The real form of this tree is not perceived in this world, neither its beginning nor end, nor its continued existence.  But this deep-rooted aśhvatth tree must be cut down with a strong axe of detachment.  Then one must search out the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord, from whom streamed forth the activity of the universe a long time ago.  Upon taking refuge in Him, one will not return to this world again."
chpt15V5,"Those who are free from vanity and delusion, who have overcome the evil of attachment, who dwell constantly on the self and on God, who are free from the desire to enjoy the senses, and are beyond the dualities of pleasure and pain, such liberated personalities attain My eternal Abode."
chpt15V6,"Neither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of Mine.  Having gone There, one does not return to this material world again."
chpt15V7,"The embodied souls in this material world are My eternal fragmental parts.  But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind."
chpt15V8,"As the air carries fragrance from place to place, so does the embodied soul carry the mind and senses with it, when it leaves an old body and enters a new one."
chpt15V9,"Using the sense perceptions of the ears, eyes, skin, tongue, and nose, which are grouped around the mind, the embodied soul savors the objects of the senses."
chpt15V10,"The ignorant do not perceive the soul as it resides in the body, and as it enjoys sense objects; nor do they perceive it when it departs.  But those who possess the eyes of knowledge can behold it."
chpt15V11,"Striving yogis too are able to realize the soul enshrined in the body.  However, those whose minds are not purified cannot cognize it, even though they strive to do so."
chpt15V12,Know that I am like the brilliance of the sun that illuminates the entire solar system.  The radiance of the moon and the brightness of the fire also come from Me.
chpt15V13,"Permeating the earth, I nourish all living beings with My energy.  Becoming the moon, I nourish all plants with the juice of life."
chpt15V14,"It is I who take the form of the fire of digestion in the stomachs of all living beings, and combine with the incoming and outgoing breaths, to digest and assimilate the four kinds of foods."
chpt15V15,"I am seated in the hearts of all living beings, and from Me come memory, knowledge, as well as forgetfulness.  I alone am to be known by all the Vedas, am the author of the Vedant, and the knower of the meaning of the Vedas."

chpt16V1,"The Supreme Divine Personality said: O scion of Bharat, these are the saintly virtues of those endowed with a divine nature—fearlessness, purity of mind, steadfastness in spiritual knowledge, charity, control of the senses, sacrifice, study of the sacred books, austerity, and straightforwardness; non-violence, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, restraint from fault-finding, compassion toward all living beings, absence of covetousness, gentleness, modesty, and lack of fickleness; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, bearing enmity toward none, and absence of vanity."
chpt16V4,"O Parth, the qualities of those who possess a demoniac nature are hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, and ignorance."
chpt16V5,"The divine qualities lead to liberation, while the demoniac qualities are the cause for a continuing destiny of bondage. Grieve not, O Arjun, as you were born with saintly virtues."
chpt16V6,"There are two kinds of beings in this world—those endowed with a divine nature and those possessing a demoniac nature. I have described the divine qualities in detail, O Arjun. Now hear from me about the demoniac nature."
chpt16V7,"Those possessing a demoniac nature do not comprehend which actions are proper and which are improper. Hence, they possess neither purity, nor good conduct, nor even truthfulness."
chpt16V8,"They say, “The world is without Absolute Truth, without any basis (for moral order), and without a God (who has created or is controlling it). It is created from the combination of the two sexes, and has no purpose other than sexual gratification.”"
chpt16V9,"Holding fast to such views, these misdirected souls, with small intellect and cruel actions, arise as enemies of the world threatening its destruction."
chpt16V10,"Harboring insatiable lust, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, the demoniac cling to their false tenets. Thus illusioned, they are attracted to the impermanent and work with impure resolve."
chpt16V11,"They are obsessed with endless anxieties that end only with death. Still, they maintain with complete assurance that gratification of desires and accumulation of wealth is the highest purpose of life."
chpt16V12,"Held in bondage by hundreds of desires, and driven by lust and anger, they strive to accumulate wealth by unjust means, all for the gratification of their senses."
chpt16V13,"The demoniac persons think, “I have gained so much wealth today, and I shall now fulfill this desire of mine. This is mine, and tomorrow I shall have even more. That enemy has been destroyed by me, and I shall destroy the others too! I am like God Himself, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, I am powerful, and I am happy. I am wealthy and I have highly placed relatives. Who else is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifices (to the celestial gods); I shall give alms; I shall rejoice.” In this way, they are deluded by ignorance."
chpt16V16,"Possessed and led astray by such imaginings, enveloped in a mesh of delusion, and addicted to the gratification of sensuous pleasures, they descend to the murkiest hell."
chpt16V17,"Such self-conceited and stubborn people, full of pride and arrogant in their wealth, perform ostentatious sacrifices in name only, with no regard to the rules of the scriptures."
chpt16V18,"Blinded by egotism, strength, arrogance, desire, and anger, the demonic abuse Me, who am present in their own body and in the bodies of others."
chpt16V19,"These cruel and hateful persons, the vile and vicious of humankind, I constantly hurl into the wombs of those with similar demoniac natures in the cycle of rebirth in the material world. These ignorant souls take birth again and again in demoniac wombs. Failing to reach Me, O Arjun, they gradually sink to the most abominable type of existence."
chpt16V21,"There are three gates leading to the hell of self-destruction for the soul—lust, anger, and greed. Therefore, one should abandon all three."
chpt16V22,"Those who are free from the three gates to darkness endeavor for the welfare of their soul, and thereby attain the supreme goal."
chpt16V23,"Those who act under the impulse of desire, discarding the injunctions of the scriptures, attain neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme goal in life."
chpt16V24,"Therefore, let the scriptures be your authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done. Understand the scriptural injunctions and teachings, and then perform your actions in this world accordingly."
chpt17V1,"Arjun said: O Krishna, where do they stand who disregard the injunctions of the scriptures, but still worship with faith? Is their faith in the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance?"
chpt17V2,"The Supreme Divine Personality said: Every human being is born with innate faith, which can be of three kinds—"
chpt17V3,"The faith of all humans conforms to the nature of their mind. All people possess faith, and whatever the nature of their faith, that is verily what they are."
chpt17V4,Those in the mode of goodness worship the celestial gods; those in the mode of passion worship the
chpt17V5,"Some people perform stern austerities that are not enjoined by the scriptures, but rather motivated by hypocrisy and egotism. Impelled by desire and attachment, they torment not only the elements of their body, but also I who dwell within them as the Supreme Soul. Know these senseless people to be of demoniacal resolves."
chpt17V7,"The food that people prefer is according to their dispositions. The same is true for the sacrifice, austerity, and charity they are inclined (or predisposed) toward. Now hear of the distinctions from Me."
chpt17V8,"Persons in the mode of goodness prefer foods that promote life span, and increase virtue, strength, health, happiness, and satisfaction. Such foods are juicy, succulent, nourishing, and naturally tasteful."
chpt17V9,"Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, very hot, pungent, dry, and full of chillies, are dear to persons in the mode of passion. Such foods produce pain, grief, and disease."
chpt17V10,"Foods that are overcooked, stale, putrid, polluted, and impure are dear to persons in the mode of ignorance."
chpt17V11,"Sacrifice that is performed according to scriptural injunctions without expectation of rewards, with the firm conviction of the mind that it is a matter of duty, is of the nature of goodness."
chpt17V12,"O best of the Bharatas, know that sacrifice performed for material benefit, or with a hypocritical aim, is in the mode of passion."
chpt17V13,"Sacrifice devoid of faith and contrary to the injunctions of the scriptures, in which no food is offered, no mantras chanted, and no donation made, is to be considered in the mode of ignorance."
chpt17V14,"When worship of the Supreme Lord, the Brahmins, the spiritual master, the wise, and the elders is done with the observance of cleanliness, simplicity, celibacy, and non-violence then this worship is declared as the austerity of the body."
chpt17V15,"Words that do not cause distress, are truthful, inoffensive, and beneficial, as well as regular recitation of the Vedic scriptures—these are declared as austerity of speech."
chpt17V16,"Serenity of thought, gentleness, silence, self-control, and purity of purpose—all these are declared as austerity of the mind."
chpt17V17,"When devout persons with ardent faith practice these three-fold austerities without yearning for material rewards, they are designated as austerities in the mode of goodness."
chpt17V18,"Austerity that is performed with ostentation for the sake of gaining honor, respect, and adoration is in the mode of passion. Its benefits are unstable and transitory."
chpt17V19,"Austerity that is performed by those with confused notions, and which involves torturing the self or harming others, is described to be in the mode of ignorance."
chpt17V20,"Charity given to a worthy person simply because it is right to give, without consideration of anything in return, at the proper time and in the proper place, is stated to be in the mode of goodness."
chpt17V21,"But charity given with reluctance, with the hope of a return or in expectation of a reward, is said to be in the mode of passion."
chpt17V22,"And that charity, which is given at the wrong place and wrong time to unworthy persons, without showing respect, or with contempt, is held to be of the nature of nescience."
chpt17V23,"The words “Om Tat Sat” have been declared as symbolic representations of the Supreme Absolute Truth, from the beginning of creation. From them came the priests, scriptures, and sacrifice."
chpt17V24,"Therefore, when performing acts of sacrifice, offering charity, or undertaking penance, expounders of the Vedas always begin by uttering “Om” according to the prescriptions of Vedic injunctions."
chpt17V25,"Persons who do not desire fruitive rewards, but seek to be free from material entanglements, utter the word “Tat” along with acts of austerity, sacrifice, and charity."
chpt17V26,"The word “Sat” means eternal existence and goodness. O Arjun, it is also used to describe an auspicious action. Being established in the performance of sacrifice, penance, and charity, is also described by the word “Sat.” And so any act for such purposes is named “Sat.”"
chpt17V28,"O son of Pritha, whatever acts of sacrifice, charity, or penance are done without faith, are termed as"
chpt18V1,"Arjun said: O mighty-armed Krishna, I wish to understand the nature of"
chpt18V2,The Supreme Divine Personality said: Giving up of actions motivated by desire is what the wise understand as
chpt18V3,"Some learned people declare that all kinds of actions should be given up as evil, while others maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity, and penance should never be abandoned."
chpt18V4,"Now hear My conclusion on the subject of renunciation, O tiger amongst men, for renunciation has been declared to be of three kinds."
chpt18V5,"Actions based upon sacrifice, charity, and penance should never be abandoned; they must certainly be performed. Indeed, acts of sacrifice, charity, and penance are purifying even for those who are wise."
chpt18V6,"These activities must be performed without attachment and expectation for rewards. This is My definite and supreme verdict, O Arjun."
chpt18V7,Prescribed duties should never be renounced. Such deluded renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.
chpt18V8,To give up prescribed duties because they are troublesome or cause bodily discomfort is renunciation in the mode of passion. Such renunciation is never beneficial or elevating.
chpt18V9,"When actions are undertaken in response to duty, and one relinquishes attachment to any reward, O Arjun, it is considered renunciation in the nature of goodness."
chpt18V10,Those who neither avoid disagreeable work nor seek work because it is agreeable are persons of true renunciation. They are endowed with the quality of the mode of goodness and have no doubts (about the nature of work).
chpt18V11,"For the embodied being, it is impossible to give up activities entirely. But those who relinquish the fruits of their actions are said to be truly renounced."
chpt18V12,"The three-fold fruits of actions—pleasant, unpleasant, and mixed—accrue even after death to those who are attached to personal reward. But, for those who renounce the fruits of their actions, there are no such results in the here or hereafter."

chpt18V14,"The body, the doer (soul), the various senses, the many kinds of efforts, and Divine Providence—these are the five factors of action."
chpt18V15,"These five are the contributory factors for whatever action is performed, whether proper or improper, with body, speech, or mind. Those who do not understand this regard the soul as the only doer. With their impure intellects they cannot see things as they are."
chpt18V17,"Those who are free from the ego of being the doer, and whose intellect is unattached, though they may slay living beings, they neither kill nor are they bound by actions."
chpt18V18,"Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower—these are the three factors that induce action. The instrument of action, the act itself, and the doer—these are the three constituents of action."
chpt18V19,"Knowledge, action, and the doer are declared to be of three kinds in the"
chpt18V20,Understand that knowledge to be in the mode of goodness by which a person sees one undivided imperishable reality within all diverse living beings.
chpt18V21,That knowledge is to be considered in the mode of passion by which one sees manifold living entities in diverse bodies as individual and unconnected.
chpt18V22,"That knowledge is said to be in the mode of ignorance where one is engrossed in a fragmental concept as if it encompasses the whole, and which is neither grounded in reason nor based on the truth."
chpt18V23,"Action that is in accordance with the scriptures, free from attachment and aversion, and done without desire for rewards, is in the mode of goodness."
chpt18V24,"Action that is prompted by selfish desire, enacted with pride, and full of stress, is in the nature of passion."

chpt18V26,"The performer is said to be in the mode of goodness, when he or she is free from egotism and attachment, endowed with enthusiasm and determination, and equipoised in success and failure."
chpt18V27,"The performer is considered in the mode of passion when he or she craves the fruits of the work, is covetous, violent-natured, impure, and moved by joy and sorrow."
chpt18V28,"A performer in the mode of ignorance is one who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, slothful, despondent, and a procrastinator."
chpt18V29,"Hear now, O Arjun, of the distinctions of intellect and determination, according to the three modes of material nature, as I describe them in detail."
chpt18V30,"The intellect is said to be in the nature of goodness, O Parth, when it understands what is proper action and improper action, what is duty and non-duty, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating."
chpt18V31,"The intellect is considered in the mode of passion when it is confused between righteousness and unrighteousness, and cannot distinguish between right and wrong conduct, O Parth."
chpt18V32,"That intellect which is shrouded in darkness, imagining irreligion to be religion, and perceiving untruth to be the truth, is of the nature of ignorance, O Parth."
chpt18V33,"The steadfast willpower that is developed through Yog, and which sustains the activities of the mind, the life-airs, and the senses,  O Parth, is said to be determination in the mode of goodness."
chpt18V34,"The steadfast willpower by which one holds on to duty, pleasures, and wealth, out of attachment and desire for rewards, O Arjun, is determination in the mode of passion."
chpt18V35,"That unintelligent resolve is said to be determination in the mode of ignorance, in which one does not give up dreaming, fearing, grieving, despair, and conceit."
chpt18V36,"Now hear from Me, O Arjun, of the three kinds of happiness in which the embodied soul rejoices, and can even reach the end of all suffering."
chpt18V37,"That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end, is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness. It is generated by the pure intellect that is situated in self-knowledge."
chpt18V38,Happiness is said to be in the mode of passion when it is derived from the contact of the senses with their objects. Such happiness is like nectar at first but poison at the end.
chpt18V39,"That happiness which covers the nature of the self from beginning to end, and which is derived from sleep, indolence, and negligence, is said to be in the mode of ignorance."
chpt18V40,No living being on earth or the higher celestial abodes of this material realm is free from the influence of these three modes of nature.
chpt18V41,"The duties of the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras—are distributed according to their qualities, in accordance with their"
chpt18V42,"Tranquility, restraint, austerity, purity, patience, integrity, knowledge, wisdom, and belief in a hereafter—these are the intrinsic qualities of work for Brahmins."
chpt18V43,"Valor, strength, fortitude, skill in weaponry, resolve never to retreat from battle, large-heartedness in charity, and leadership abilities, these are the natural qualities of work for Kshatriyas."
chpt18V44,"Agriculture, dairy farming, and commerce are the natural works for those with the qualities of Vaishyas. Serving through work is the natural duty for those with the qualities of Shudras."
chpt18V45,"By fulfilling their duties, born of their innate qualities, human beings can attain perfection. Now hear from Me how one can become perfect by discharging one’s prescribed duties."
chpt18V46,"By performing one’s natural occupation, one worships the Creator from whom all living entities have come into being, and by whom the whole universe is pervaded. By such performance of work, a person easily attains perfection."
chpt18V47,It is better to do one’s own
chpt18V48,"One should not abandon duties born of one’s nature, even if one sees defects in them, O son of Kunti. Indeed, all endeavors are veiled by some evil, as fire is by smoke."
chpt18V49,"Those whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who have mastered the mind, and are free from desires by the practice of renunciation, attain the highest perfection of freedom from action."
chpt18V50,"Hear from Me briefly, O Arjun, and I shall explain how one, who has attained perfection (of cessation of actions), can also attain Brahman by being firmly fixed in transcendental knowledge."
chpt18V51,"One becomes fit to attain Brahman when he or she possesses a purified intellect and firmly restrains the senses, abandoning sound and other objects of the senses, casting aside attraction and aversion. Such a person relishes solitude, eats lightly, controls body, mind, and speech, is ever engaged in meditation, and practices dispassion. Free from egotism, violence, arrogance, desire, possessiveness of property, and selfishness, such a person, situated in tranquility, is fit for union with Brahman (i.e., realization of the Absolute Truth as Brahman)."
chpt18V54,"One situated in the transcendental Brahman realization becomes mentally serene, neither grieving nor desiring. Being equitably disposed toward all living beings, such a yogi attains supreme devotion unto Me."
chpt18V55,"Only by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth. Then, having come to know Me, My devotee enters into full consciousness of Me."
chpt18V56,"My devotees, though performing all kinds of actions, take full refuge in Me. By my grace, they attain the eternal and imperishable abode."
chpt18V57,"Dedicate your every activity to Me, making Me your supreme goal. Taking shelter of the Yog of the intellect, keep your consciousness absorbed in Me always."
chpt18V58,"If you always remember Me, by My grace you shall overcome all obstacles and difficulties. But if, due to pride, you do not listen to My advice, you will perish."
chpt18V59,"If, motivated by pride, you think, “I shall not fight,” your decision will be in vain. Your own nature will compel you to fight."
chpt18V60,"O Arjun, that action which out of delusion you do not wish to do, you will be driven to do it by your own inclination, born of your own material nature."
chpt18V61,"The Supreme Lord dwells in the hearts of all living beings, O Arjun. According to their karmas, He directs the wanderings of the souls, who are seated on a machine made of material energy."
chpt18V62,"Surrender exclusively unto Him with your whole being, O Bharat. By His grace, you will attain perfect peace and the eternal abode."
chpt18V63,"Thus, I have explained to you this knowledge that is more secret than all secrets. Ponder over it deeply, and then do as you wish."
chpt18V64,"Hear again My supreme instruction, the most confidential of all knowledge. I am revealing this for your benefit because you are very dear to Me."
chpt18V65,"Always think of Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and offer obeisance to Me. Doing so, you will certainly come to Me. This is My pledge to you, for you are very dear to Me."
chpt18V66,Abandon all varieties of dharmas and simply surrender unto Me alone. I shall liberate you from all sinful reactions; do not fear.
chpt18V67,"This instruction should never be explained to those who are not austere or to those who are not devoted. It should also not be spoken to those who are averse to listening (to spiritual topics), and especially not to those who are envious of Me."
chpt18V68,"Amongst My devotees, those who teach this most confidential knowledge perform the greatest act of love. They will come to Me, without doubt."
chpt18V69,No human being does more loving service to Me than they; nor shall there ever be anyone on this earth more dear to Me.
chpt18V70,And I proclaim that those who study this sacred dialogue of ours will worship Me (with their intellect) through the sacrifice of knowledge; such is My view.
chpt18V71,Even those who only listen to this knowledge with faith and without envy will be liberated from sins and attain the auspicious abodes where the pious dwell.
chpt18V72,"O Arjun, have you heard Me with a concentrated mind? Have your ignorance and delusion been destroyed?"
chpt18V73,"Arjun said: O Infallible One, by your grace my illusion has been dispelled, and I am situated in knowledge. I am now free from doubts, and I shall act according to Your instructions."
chpt18V74,"Sanjay said: Thus, have I heard this wonderful conversation between Shree Krishna, the Son of Vasudev, and Arjun, the noble-hearted son of Pritha. So thrilling is the message that my hair is standing on end."
chpt18V75,"By the grace of Veda Vyas, I have heard this supreme and most secret Yog from the Lord of Yog, Shree Krishna Himself."
chpt18V76,"As I repeatedly recall this astonishing and wonderful dialogue between the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun, O King, I rejoice again and again."
chpt18V77,"And remembering that most astonishing and wonderful cosmic form of Lord Krishna, great is my astonishment, and I am thrilled with joy over and over again."
chpt18V78,"Wherever there is Shree Krishna, the Lord of all Yog, and wherever there is Arjun, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be unending opulence, victory, prosperity, and righteousness. Of this, I am certain."
