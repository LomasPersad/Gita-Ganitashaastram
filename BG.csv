['धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः |', 'मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ||1||'];Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?
['दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।', 'आचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ।। 2।।'];Sanjay said: On observing the Pandava army standing in military formation, King Duryodhan approached his teacher Dronacharya, and said the following words.
['पश्यैतां पाण्डुपुत्राणामाचार्य महतीं चमूम् ।'];Duryodhan said: Respected teacher!  Behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed for battle by your own gifted disciple, the son of Drupad.
['अत्र शूरा महेष्वासा भीमार्जुनसमा युधि ', ' युयुधानो विराटश्च द्रुपदश्च महारथ: || 4||', 'धृष्टकेतुश्चेकितान: काशिराजश्च वीर्यवान् |', 'पुरुजित्कुन्तिभोजश्च शैब्यश्च नरपुङ्गव: || 5||', 'युधामन्युश्च विक्रान्त उत्तमौजाश्च वीर्यवान् |'];Behold in their ranks are many powerful warriors, like Yuyudhan, Virat, and Drupad, wielding mighty bows and equal in military prowess to Bheem and Arjun.  There are also accomplished heroes like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the gallant King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Shaibya—all the best of men.  In their ranks, they also have the courageous Yudhamanyu, the gallant Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, who are all great warrior chiefs.
['अस्माकं तु विशिष्टा ये तान्निबोध द्विजोत्तम |'];O best of Brahmins, hear too about the principal generals on our side, who are especially qualified to lead. These I now recount unto you.
['भवान्भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च कृपश्च समितिञ्जय: |'];There are personalities like yourself, Bheeshma, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Vikarn, and Bhurishrava, who are ever victorious in battle.
['अन्ये च बहव: शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविता: |'];Also, there are many other heroic warriors, who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. They are all skilled in the art of warfare, and equipped with various kinds of weapons.
['अपर्याप्तं तदस्माकं बलं भीष्माभिरक्षितम् |'];The strength of our army is unlimited and we are safely marshalled by Grandsire Bheeshma, while the strength of the Pandava army, carefully marshalled by Bheem, is limited.
['अयनेषु च सर्वेषु यथाभागमवस्थिता: |'];Therefore, I call upon all the generals of the Kaurava army now to give full support to Grandsire Bheeshma, even as you defend your respective strategic points.
['तस्य सञ्जनयन्हर्षं कुरुवृद्ध: पितामह: |'];Then, the grand old man of the Kuru dynasty, the glorious patriarch Bheeshma, roared like a lion, and blew his conch shell very loudly, giving joy to Duryodhan.
['तत: शङ्खाश्च भेर्यश्च पणवानकगोमुखा: |'];Thereafter, conches, kettledrums, bugles, trumpets, and horns suddenly blared forth, and their combined sound was overwhelming.
['तत: श्वेतैर्हयैर्युक्ते महति स्यन्दने स्थितौ |'];Then, from amidst the Pandava army, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Madhav and Arjun blew their Divine conch shells.
['पाञ्चजन्यं हृषीकेशो देवदत्तं धनञ्जय: |'];Hrishikesh blew his conch shell, called Panchajanya, and Arjun blew the Devadutta. Bheem, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his mighty conch, called Paundra.
['अनन्तविजयं राजा कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिर: |', 'नकुल: सहदेवश्च सुघोषमणिपुष्पकौ || 16||', 'काश्यश्च परमेष्वास: शिखण्डी च महारथ: |', 'धृष्टद्युम्नो विराटश्च सात्यकिश्चापराजित: || 17||', 'द्रुपदो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्वश: पृथिवीपते |'];King Yudhishthir, blew the Anantavijay, while Nakul and Sahadev blew the Sughosh and Manipushpak. The excellent archer and king of Kashi, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virat, and the invincible Satyaki, Drupad, the five sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conch shells, O Ruler of the earth.
['स घोषो धार्तराष्ट्राणां हृदयानि व्यदारयत् |'];The terrific sound thundered across the sky and the earth, and shattered the hearts of your sons, O Dhritarasthra.
['प्रवृत्ते शस्त्रसम्पाते धनुरुद्यम्य पाण्डव: ||20||', 'हृषीकेशं तदा वाक्यमिदमाह महीपते |'];At that time, the son of Pandu, Arjun, who had the insignia of Hanuman on the flag of his chariot, took up his bow. Seeing your sons arrayed against him, O King, Arjun then spoke the following words to Shree Krishna.
['अर्जुन उवाच |', 'सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये रथं स्थापय मेऽच्युत || 21||', 'यावदेतान्निरीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकामानवस्थितान् |'];Arjun said: O Infallible One, please take my chariot to the middle of both armies, so that I may look at the warriors arrayed for battle, whom I must fight in this great combat.
['योत्स्यमानानवेक्षेऽहं य एतेऽत्र समागता: |'];I desire to see those who have come here to fight on the side of the evil-minded son of Dhritarasthra, wishing to please him.
['एवमुक्तो हृषीकेशो गुडाकेशेन भारत |', 'सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये स्थापयित्वा रथोत्तमम् || 24||'];Sanjay said: O Dhritarasthra, having thus been addressed by Arjun, the conqueror of sleep, Shree Krishna then drew the magnificent chariot between the two armies.
['भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखत: सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम् |'];In the presence of Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and all the other kings, Shree Krishna said: O Parth, behold these Kurus gathered here.
['आचार्यान्मातुलान्भ्रातृ न्पुत्रान्पौत्रान्सखींस्तथा || 26||', 'श्वशुरान्सुहृदश्चैव सेनयोरुभयोरपि |'];There, Arjun could see stationed in both armies, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, cousins, sons, nephews, grand-nephews, friends, fathers-in-law, and well-wishers.
['तान्समीक्ष्य स कौन्तेय: सर्वान्बन्धूनवस्थितान् || 27||'];Seeing all his relatives present there, Arjun, the son of Kunti, was overwhelmed with compassion, and with deep sorrow, spoke the following words.
['दृष्ट्वेमं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम् || 28||', 'सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति |'];Arjun said: O Krishna, seeing my own kinsmen arrayed for battle here and intent on killing each other, my limbs are giving way and my mouth is drying up.
['गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चै व परिदह्यते |', 'न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मन: || 30|| ', 'निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव |', 'न च श्रेयोऽनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे || 31||'];"My whole body shudders; my hair is standing on end. My bow, the Gāṇḍīv, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle."
['न काङ्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च |', 'किं नो राज्येन गोविन्द किं भोगैर्जीवितेन वा || 32||', 'येषामर्थे काङ्क्षितं नो राज्यं भोगा: सुखानि च |'];O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it. Of what avail will be a kingdom, pleasures, or even life itself, when the very persons for whom we covet them, are standing before us for battle?
['आचार्या: पितर: पुत्रास्तथैव च पितामहा: |', 'मातुला: श्वशुरा: पौत्रा: श्याला: सम्बन्धिनस्तथा || 34|| ', 'एतान्न हन्तुमिच्छामि घ्नतोऽपि मधुसूदन |'];Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, grandsons, fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen are present here, staking their lives and riches. O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?
['निहत्य धार्तराष्ट्रान्न: का प्रीति: स्याज्जनार्दन |', 'पापमेवाश्रयेदस्मान्हत्वैतानाततायिन: || 36 || ', 'तस्मान्नार्हा वयं हन्तुं धार्तराष्ट्रान्स्वबान्धवान् |'];O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them. Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?
['यद्यप्येते न पश्यन्ति लोभोपहतचेतस: |', 'कुलक्षयकृतं दोषं मित्रद्रोहे च पातकम् || 38||', 'कथं न ज्ञेयमस्माभि: पापादस्मान्निवर्तितुम् |'];Their thoughts are overpowered by greed and they see no wrong in annihilating their relatives or wreaking treachery upon friends. Yet, O Janardan (Krishna), why should we, who can clearly see the crime in killing our kindred, not turn away from this sin?
['कुलक्षये प्रणश्यन्ति कुलधर्मा: सनातना: |'];When a dynasty is destroyed, its traditions get vanquished, and the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.
['अधर्माभिभवात्कृष्ण प्रदुष्यन्ति कुलस्त्रिय: |'];"With the preponderance of vice, O Krishna, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, O descendent of Vrishni, unwanted progeny are born."
['सङ्करो नरकायैव कुलघ्नानां कुलस्य च |'];An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall.
['दोषैरेतै: कुलघ्नानां वर्णसङ्करकारकै: |'];Through the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted progeny, a variety of social and family welfare activities are ruined.
['उत्सन्नकुलधर्माणां मनुष्याणां जनार्दन |'];O Janardan (Krishna), I have heard from the learned that those who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time.
['अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम् |', 'यद्राज्यसुखलोभेन हन्तुं स्वजनमुद्यता: || 45||', 'यदि मामप्रतीकारमशस्त्रं शस्त्रपाणय: |'];Alas! How strange it is that we have set our mind to perform this great sin with horrifying consequences. Driven by the desire for kingly pleasures, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. It would be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.
['एवमुक्त्वार्जुन: सङ्ख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत् |', 'विसृज्य सशरं चापं शोकसंविग्नमानस: || 47||'];Sanjay said: Speaking thus, Arjun cast aside his bow and arrows, and sank into the seat of his chariot, his mind in distress and overwhelmed with grief.
